# NobodysNightmare's Screeps AI

This is my personal AI for the computer game [Screeps](https://screeps.com).

## TODOs

* Use links
    * ... to collect energy at central storage
    * ... to move energy to controller
    * ... to collect energy from remote mines at room border
* Better defense mechanics
    * towers should attack target picked by defense aspect
    * defense aspect should actually "think" about which target to pick
    * while defending a reloader should keep towers supplied with energy
* Rework room claiming
    * more independence on "main" room
    * more accessible way to initiate claiming
    * automatically start claiming as soon as room is ready
* Properly support multiple Spawns
* Be more conservative during supply shortage
    * e.g. only spawn one upgrader
